        "overview": "The sustainability of new HR systems and process improvements established with our consultancy services is as important as establishing them. Even the best practices can lose their effectiveness over time without regular monitoring and control mechanisms.\n\nWith this service, we establish a systematic monitoring and reporting infrastructure for all improvements to be permanent. We determine critical performance indicators (KPIs) such as 'document completion rate' or 'open risk number', design monthly/quarterly/annual periodic audit plans and clear management report formats. Our goal is to enable you to manage your HR and compliance processes based on data, to initiate a continuous improvement cycle, and to guarantee that the gains achieved are permanent.",

Corporate compliance and operational efficiency can be achieved by transferring this knowledge to practice rather than theoretical knowledge.\n\nWith this service, we offer specially designed 'applied' training programs for HR teams and managers. Contrary to boring legislation presentations, we address critical topics such as HR compliance, KVKK, and file management through interactive workshop studies. Our trainings are built on case studies based on your company's realities, practical checklists, and template applications. As a result of our trainings, we aim to ensure that participants move from the 'knowing' level to the 'being able to apply' level and make the acquired competencies an integral part of their daily workflows.",
